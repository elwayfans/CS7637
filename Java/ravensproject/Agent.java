     * For each problem, your Agent's Solve() method will be called. At the
     * conclusion of Solve(), your Agent should return a String representing its
     * answer to the question: "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", or "6". These Strings
     * are also the Names of the individual RavensFigures, obtained through
     * RavensFigure.getName().
     * 
     * In addition to returning your answer at the end of the method, your Agent
     * may also call problem.checkAnswer(String givenAnswer). The parameter
     * passed to checkAnswer should be your Agent's current guess for the
     * problem; checkAnswer will return the correct answer to the problem. This
     * allows your Agent to check its answer. Note, however, that after your
     * agent has called checkAnswer, it will *not* be able to change its answer.
     * checkAnswer is used to allow your Agent to learn from its incorrect
     * answers; however, your Agent cannot change the answer to a question it
     * has already answered.
     * 
     * If your Agent calls checkAnswer during execution of Solve, the answer it
     * returns will be ignored; otherwise, the answer returned at the end of
     * Solve will be taken as your Agent's answer to this problem.
